## Zoo CAD Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
You are designing a custom dental grill (decorative jewelry overlay for teeth).
The design must be manufacturable via SLA 3D printing or CNC milling.
All dimensions are in millimeters. Biocompatibility is critical.
No sharp edges on inner surfaces. Output as watertight STL.
