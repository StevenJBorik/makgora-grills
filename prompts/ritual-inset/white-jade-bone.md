## Zoo CAD Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
You are designing a custom dental grill (decorative jewelry overlay for teeth).
The design must be manufacturable via SLA 3D printing or CNC milling.
All dimensions are in millimeters. Biocompatibility is critical.
No sharp edges on inner surfaces. Output as watertight STL.

Design a custom fantasy dental grill.

ARCHETYPE: Ritual Inset
PALETTE: White Jade Bone
STYLE MOOD: Ritual

RITUAL INSET DETAILS:
- Negative space cutouts creating rune-like patterns
- Ultra-light construction (0.8mm total max)
- Abstract sacred geometry (non-IP, original patterns)
- Open framework design - tooth visible through voids
- Ancestral/shamanic ceremonial aesthetic

GEOMETRY:
- Target teeth: Upper canines + laterals
- Max visible shell thickness: 0.8mm (ultra-light)
- Min structural thickness: 0.5mm (at bridges)
- Inner clearance from tooth: 0.1mm uniform
- Void area: 30-40% of total surface area

MATERIAL LOOK:
- Primary: White jade #F2F4EE
- Vein details: Sage green #7FAF95 (painted/inlaid)
- Shadows: Natural shadows through voids
- Metal: None (pure bone/jade aesthetic)

DETAIL FEATURES:
- Rune voids: Abstract geometric, 0.5mm minimum width
- Pattern: Interconnected angular shapes (not circles)
- Bridges: 0.8mm minimum width for structural integrity
- Edge treatment: Slightly rounded (0.15mm radius)

COMFORT REQUIREMENTS:
- Zero gum pressure (0.5mm clearance at gumline)
- Inner surface fillets: 0.2mm minimum (thinner design)
- Lingual hollowing: Not needed (already minimal mass)
- Retention: friction-fit at key anchor points only

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
- Single body STL with through-voids
- Mesh must be watertight despite voids
- Mesh resolution: minimum 100k triangles
- Verify all bridges > 0.5mm for printability
```

## Manufacturing Notes

- **Primary material:** White/ivory SLA resin
- **Alternative:** Zirconia (ceramic) for true bone-white
- **Vein accent:** Hand-painted sage green detail
- **Weight:** Should be ultra-light (under 2g per side)
- **Fragility note:** Handle with care, bridges are thin
