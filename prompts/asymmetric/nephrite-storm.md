## Zoo CAD Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
You are designing a custom dental grill (decorative jewelry overlay for teeth).
The design must be manufacturable via SLA 3D printing or CNC milling.
All dimensions are in millimeters. Biocompatibility is critical.
No sharp edges on inner surfaces. Output as watertight STL.

Design a custom fantasy dental grill.

ARCHETYPE: Asymmetric War Fang
PALETTE: Nephrite Storm
STYLE MOOD: Battle-worn

ASYMMETRIC WAR FANG DETAILS:
- LEFT canine: Full armored cap with storm jade detail
- RIGHT canine: Minimal band only (1mm at gumline)
- Creates dramatic visual tension and asymmetry
- Suggests battle damage or ritual sacrifice of symmetry
- Both sides maintain all comfort constraints

GEOMETRY:
- Target teeth: Both upper canines (asymmetric treatment)
- LEFT: Full wrap, 4mm visual depth, max 1.4mm thickness
- RIGHT: Thin band only, 1mm height, 0.8mm thickness
- Inner clearance: 0.1mm uniform on both
- No forward extension on either side

MATERIAL LOOK:
- Primary: Storm jade #1E3F2B
- Weathering: Cloud texture #4A6B55 (raised areas)
- Shadows: #0B1F15 in recesses
- Metal accent: Blackened iron #2C2C2C band on left cap

DETAIL FEATURES:
- LEFT cap: Battle scarring texture (random scratches)
- LEFT cap: Blackened metal band at top edge
- RIGHT band: Simple, clean, minimal
- Contrast: Heavy detail left vs pure simplicity right

COMFORT REQUIREMENTS:
- Zero gum pressure on both sides
- All inner surface fillets: 0.3mm minimum radius
- LEFT: Lingual hollowing for weight reduction
- RIGHT: Solid due to minimal mass
- Retention: friction-fit via undercuts

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
- LEFT cap body: Full jade + metal accent STL
- RIGHT band body: Minimal band STL
- Metal accent: Separate STL for left cap
- Mesh resolution: minimum 100k triangles per body

## Manufacturing Notes

- **Left cap:** Anodized Titanium (jade tones) + steel accent band
- **Right band:** Plain titanium, minimal
- **Finish:** Matte/weathered left, clean satin right
- **Asymmetry note:** Creates visual interest, conversation piece
