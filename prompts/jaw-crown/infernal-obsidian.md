## Zoo CAD Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
You are designing a custom dental grill (decorative jewelry overlay for teeth).
The design must be manufacturable via SLA 3D printing or CNC milling.
All dimensions are in millimeters. Biocompatibility is critical.
No sharp edges on inner surfaces. Output as watertight STL.

Design a custom fantasy dental grill.

ARCHETYPE: Jaw Crown
PALETTE: Infernal Obsidian
STYLE MOOD: Corrupted

JAW CROWN DETAILS:
- Full lower anterior coverage (canine to canine, 6 teeth)
- Armor-style segmented look, cracked obsidian pattern
- Lava/fire visible through cracks
- Volcanic demon aesthetic
- Aligned to occlusal plane

GEOMETRY:
- Target teeth: Lower 6 anterior (canine to canine)
- Max visible shell thickness: 1.4mm
- Min inner shell thickness: 0.6mm
- Inner clearance from tooth: 0.1mm uniform
- Crack pattern: Organic fractures across surface

MATERIAL LOOK:
- Primary: Obsidian black #0E0E10
- Vein/crack fill: Lava red #FF3B1F
- Finish: Glossy obsidian faces, glow in crack channels

DETAIL FEATURES:
- Crack channels: 0.4-0.8mm wide, 0.3mm deep
- Pattern: Random but balanced fracture network
- Density: Cracks originate from center, spread outward
- Glow effect: Crack channels for red resin inlay

COMFORT REQUIREMENTS:
- Zero gum pressure (0.5mm clearance at gumline)
- All inner surface fillets: 0.3mm minimum radius
- Even weight distribution across all 6 teeth
- Retention: friction-fit via 0.25mm undercuts

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
- Main body: Black obsidian STL
- Crack channel body: Separate STL for red inlay
- Mesh resolution: minimum 150k triangles
- Both bodies share origin for alignment

## Manufacturing Notes

- **Primary material:** Black SLA resin, high-gloss finish
- **Crack inlay:** Red translucent resin OR red LED fiber (advanced)
- **Effect:** With LED fiber, can actually glow
- **Alternative:** Paint red in cracks (simpler)
