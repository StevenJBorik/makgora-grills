## Zoo CAD Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
You are designing a custom dental grill (decorative jewelry overlay for teeth).
The design must be manufacturable via SLA 3D printing or CNC milling.
All dimensions are in millimeters. Biocompatibility is critical.
No sharp edges on inner surfaces. Output as watertight STL.

Design a custom fantasy dental grill.

ARCHETYPE: Tusk-Base Cap
PALETTE: Blood Jade
STYLE MOOD: Battle-worn

TUSK-BASE CAP DETAILS:
- Wrap around canine root, 4mm below gumline visually
- Leave natural tooth tip exposed (2-3mm)
- Taper: 1.2mm at base to 0.6mm at margins
- Blood veins running through jade surface
- Suggests sacrifice and combat experience

GEOMETRY:
- Target teeth: Upper canines + adjacent teeth
- Max visible shell thickness: 1.4mm
- Min inner shell thickness: 0.6mm
- Inner clearance from tooth: 0.1mm uniform
- No forward extension beyond natural tooth tip

MATERIAL LOOK:
- Primary: Base #153D2E, deep forest jade
- Veins: Blood red #7B1E1E, organic flow patterns
- Highlight zones: #3F7A5A on raised edges
- Finish: Matte with satin vein channels

DETAIL FEATURES:
- Vein pattern: Organic branching from gumline downward
- Surface texture: Battle-scarring (random micro-scratches 0.03mm)
- NO metal accents - pure jade aesthetic
- Edge wear: Slightly rounded corners suggesting use

COMFORT REQUIREMENTS:
- Zero gum pressure (0.5mm clearance at gumline)
- All inner surface fillets: 0.3mm minimum radius
- Lingual hollowing for weight reduction
- Retention: friction-fit via 0.25mm interproximal undercuts

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
- Single body: Watertight manifold STL
- Mark vein channels as separate mesh group for painting
- Mesh resolution: minimum 100k triangles
- Export with vertex colors if supported

## Manufacturing Notes

- **Primary material:** SLA Dental Resin (dark green + red vein paint)
- **Alternative:** Titanium with multi-color anodization (complex)
- **Finish:** Hand-paint blood veins after printing
