## Zoo CAD Prompt

```
CONTEXT:
You are designing a custom dental grill (decorative jewelry overlay for teeth).
The design must be manufacturable via SLA 3D printing or CNC milling.
All dimensions are in millimeters. Biocompatibility is critical.
No sharp edges on inner surfaces. Output as watertight STL.

Design a custom fantasy dental grill.

ARCHETYPE: Tusk-Base Cap
PALETTE: Imperial War Jade
STYLE MOOD: Warchief

TUSK-BASE CAP DETAILS:
- Wrap around canine root, 4mm below gumline visually
- Leave natural tooth tip exposed (2-3mm)
- Taper: 1.2mm at base to 0.6mm at margins
- Illusion of downward tusk via shading zone
- Cap creates visual "tusk root" without extension

GEOMETRY:
- Target teeth: Upper canines + adjacent teeth
- Max visible shell thickness: 1.4mm
- Min inner shell thickness: 0.6mm
- Inner clearance from tooth: 0.1mm uniform
- No forward extension beyond natural tooth tip

MATERIAL LOOK:
- Primary: Base #0F5132, Highlight #2FA36B, Vein #B9E5C9
- Metal accent: Gold #D4AF37 (inlay band at gumline)
- Finish: Satin with polished gold accents

DETAIL FEATURES:
- Rune voids: Abstract negative space patterns (non-IP)
- Surface texture: Micro-etch 0.05mm depth on jade surfaces
- Vein channels: Mark 0.3mm grooves for vein color application
- Gold inlay: Separate body, 0.4mm wide band

COMFORT REQUIREMENTS:
- Zero gum pressure (0.5mm clearance at gumline)
- All inner surface fillets: 0.3mm minimum radius
- Lingual hollowing for weight reduction
- Retention: friction-fit via 0.25mm interproximal undercuts

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION:
- Main body: Watertight manifold STL (jade material)
- Inlay body: Separate STL (gold accent band)
- Mesh resolution: minimum 100k triangles
- Include color zone markers in mesh groups

## Manufacturing Notes

- **Primary material:** Anodized Titanium Grade 5 (jade tones via anodization)
- **Accent:** 14K Gold inlay band OR gold PVD coating
- **Alternative:** SLA resin with jade pigment for prototype
